The automated electron microscope image segmentation technology can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of mitochondrial research, providing new perspectives and possibilities for medical research. To address the challenge of segmenting small mitochondria in previous volume electron microscopy images, we propose an automatic mitochondrial segmentation method called GCTransNet. GCTransNet utilizes grayscale transfer techniques for image preprocessing, effectively reducing grayscale differences between different slices. By employing 3D Global Context Vision Transformers combined with global context self-attention modules and local self-attention modules, it precisely models long-distance and short-distance spatial interactions. The encoder in the 3D U-Net network is replaced with a 3D GC-ViT encoder, which computes self-attention using shifted windows. In the MitoEM mitochondrial segmentation challenge, GCTransNet achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, significantly outperforming traditional methods, thus demonstrating its superiority in automated mitochondrial segmentation.
